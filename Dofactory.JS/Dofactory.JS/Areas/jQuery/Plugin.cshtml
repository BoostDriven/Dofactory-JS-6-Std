        <div class="ptext">
            <p>
                The jQuery library is an open system that from the beginning has promoted extensibility and reuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                A common misconception is that jQuery plugins are only for open source projects to be shared with the community at large.
                If your motivation is to contribute your plugins or widgets to the open-source community then that is commendable, but don't forget that plugins can be very beneficial
                to your own projects as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you get the hang of constructing plugins you will realize that writing these is not much more difficult than writing regular JavaScript or jQuery code.
                The advantage you're getting is that they seamlessly integrate with jQuery: it is as if your enhancements shipped with the core library itself.
                A good example of this integration is chaining. Your custom methods can be chained together with any existing jQuery commands.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flexibility of JavaScript allows you to overwrite, inherit, modify, and extend the jQuery library.
                However, jQuery provides an extension point, which is the <span class="cd">jQuery.fn</span> object where you are expected to add your plugin.
                By the way: <span class="cd">jQuery.fn</span> (or <span class="cd">$.fn</span>) is just an alias to <span class="cd">jQuery.prototype</span>, so at the end your plugin
                gets added as a method to jQuery's prototype object.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="font-18 open-sans">Common Plugin patterns</b><br />
                There are three commonly used patterns to structure a plugin, they are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Function Plugin</li>
                <li>Extend Plugin</li>
                <li>Constructor Plugin</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <b class="font-18 open-sans">Function Plugin</b>: The simplest (and most popular) way is to directly add a function to <span class="cd">$.fn</span>. Here is the code:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$.fn.myPlugin = function() {                   
    alert("My first plugin!");   
};

$.myPlugin();          // => My first plugin!
</pre>
            <p>
                Here is an example plugin you can use in the real-world:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$.fn.signal = function() {
    this.slideDown(300).delay(1000).slideUp(300);   
};

</pre>
            <p>
                And this is how you use it:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div id="flash"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;!-- hidden red div --&gt;
$("#flash").signal();
</pre>
            <p>
                Click on the button to get the signal() started.
            </p>

            <button class="btn btn-green" onclick="run1();return false">Run</button><br /><br />
            <div id="flash" style="height:50px;width:600px;background:red;display:none;"></div>
            <script type="text/javascript">
                function run1() {
                    $.fn.signal = function () {
                        this.slideDown(300).delay(1000).slideUp(300);
                    };

                    $("#flash").signal();
                }
            </script>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
                This works great. It demonstrates how a simple plugin can make your jQuery life a whole lot easier.
                There is no point in sharing the above plugin as an open source project, but for your own purposes it is very useful.
            </p>
            <p>
                A weakness of the above example is that it relies on $ being an alias for jQuery which may not always be the case.
                To protect against this you can wrap the plugin in an anonymous immediate function.
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
(function ($) {
    $.fn.myPlugin = function () {             
        alert("My first plugin!");   
    };
})(jQuery);

$.myPlugin();          // => My first plugin!
</pre>
            <p>
                Much better: we can now be sure that within the closure the $ always refers to jQuery.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <b class="font-18 open-sans">Extend Plugin</b>: As an alternative you can use the jQuery's extend method:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
(function ($) {
    $.extend($.fn, {                         // Extend
        myPlugin: function () {
            alert("My first plugin!");   
        }
    });
})(jQuery);

$.myPlugin();          // => My first plugin!

</pre>
            <p>
                The <span class="cd">extend</span> method extends <span class="cd">$.fn</span> with the properties in the object literal that is provided.
                Using <span class="cd">extend</span> allows you to assign multiple properties and methods in a single statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                We should caution against adding multiple names to the <span class="cd">$.fn</span> namespace as this can lead to name collisions with jQuery itself or other plugins.
                You should consider wrapping your code base in its own namespace with a name that is unlikely to conflict with other names that may exist.
                You could use your project's name, company name, or domain name.
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
(function ($) {
    $.fn.MyCompany = {};
    $.extend($.fn MyCompany, {
        start: function () { alert("start "); },   
        stop: function () { alert("stop "); },   
        enable: function () { alert("enable "); },   
        disable: function () { alert("disable "); },   
    });
})(jQuery);

$.MyCompany.start();        // => start
$.MyCompany.enable();       // => enable

</pre>
            <p>
                Here we created a namespace called MyCompany. It is the only name we're adding to <span class="cd">$.fn</span>.
                All our methods and properties are inside the MyCompany namespace and our impact on jQuery's <span class="cd">fn</span> namespace is now minimal.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <b class="font-18 open-sans">Constructor Plugin</b>:  A third alternative is to use a private constructor function.  Here is an example:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
(function ($) {
    var Plugin = function (element) {        // Constructor
        this.element = element;
        this.$element = $(element);

        this.doSomething = function() {
            // ...
        }
    }

    $.fn.myPlugin = function () {
        return this.each(function() {
            if (!$.data(this, "myPlugin")) {
                $.data(this, "myPlugin", new Plugin(this)); 
            }
        };
    }
})(jQuery);

</pre>
            <p>
                This pattern does more than just assigning a plugin object to <span class="cd">$.fn</span>.
                It also associates an object (a Plugin instance) with each element in jQuery's result set.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cd">Plugin</span> is a constructor function that accepts a DOM element as its argument.
                The function's name is <span class="cd">Plugin</span> but could be anything because it is never exposed to the outside world.
                The real plugin name is the one you assign to <span class="cd">$.fn</span> (<span class="cd">myPlugin</span> in our example).
                In <span class="cd">Plugin</span> we declare and initialize all necessary properties and methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                The actual plugin function is added to <span class="cd">$.fn</span>.
                The context of the function is jQuery's result set which is returned to allow chaining with other jQuery methods.
                Just before returning this it iterates over each element in the result set using jQuery's built-in <span class="cd">each</span> method.
                The callback function that is passed into <span class="cd">each</span> checks if the element already has an attached <span class="cd">Plugin</span> instance;
                if not it creates one and stores it with the element. The <span class="cd">data</span> method in jQuery is a utility feature that stores arbitrary data with a specified element.
                Please note that within the callback function the value of <span class="cd">this</span> is bound to an element and <i>not</i> the result set.
            </p>
            <p>
                By associating a <span class="cd">Plugin</span> instance to each element, we have the ability to maintain plugin state for each element.
                The state is nicely packaged in a single object, rather than a set of name/value pairs.  It also makes the plugin easily reachable for each element, like so:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$("selector").data("myPlugin").doSomething();

</pre>
            <br />
            <p>
                <b class="font-18 open-sans">Constructor Plugin Template </b><br />
                Following the three jQuery plugin patterns we'll now review a more comprehensive plugin that is based on the Constructor Plugin and that you can
                use as a template for your more advanced plugin projects. This template has evolved as a best-practice model and it is based on experiences from
                numerous members in the jQuery community. You'll recognize several other patterns and practices in this code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's what the Plugin Template looks like:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
;(function ($, win, undefined) {
    var name = "myPlugin",
        defaults = {
            option1: "value1", 
            option2: "value2" 
        };
        
    var Plugin = function (element, options) {
        this.element = element;
        this.$element = $(element);

        // handle different argument options
        if (typeof options === "object")
            this.settings = $.extend({}, defaults, options || {});
        } else if (typeof options === "string") {
            // any special string value processing ...
        }
        this._name = name;
        this._defaults = defaults;

        this.init();
    }

    Plugin.prototype.init = function () {
        // initialization code
    }
    
    $.fn[name] = function (options) {
        return this.each(function() {
            if (!$.data(this, name)) {
                $.data(this, name, new Plugin(this, options)); 
            }
        };
    }

})(jQuery, window);

</pre>
            <p>
                The first thing you notice is the leading semicolon.  The Leading Semicolon idiom prevents improperly closed code from interfering with our module.
            </p>
            <p>
                The list of parameters in the immediate function (the Module Pattern) has increased to three.
                The $ parameter ensures that $ is an alias for jQuery within the module.
                The window parameter is the global object and is available as a local argument which reduces the scope traversing of the JavaScript runtime.
                Finally, the undefined parameter ensures that undefined really means undefined and not something else (in case some hacker decided to reassign its value).
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we have the Single var pattern in which two variables are declared and initialized: <span class="cd">name</span>, which is the name of the plugin and <span class="cd">defaults</span> which
                holds name/value pairs with default values for all options.  The <span class="cd">defaults</span> variable is part of the Options Hash idiom we discussed in the Essentials section.
                Note that the Single var is not 'pure' because there is another var for the Plugin function.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="cd">Plugin</span> function is a constructor function. It accepts a DOM element and a set of options.  The function's name is Plugin but it can be anything else because its name is
                not exposed to the outside world.  Remember, the real plugin name is stored in the name variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Plugin we declare and initialize all necessary properties: <span class="cd">element</span> and <span class="cd">$element</span> (we save element as both a normal
                reference and a jQuery reference to speed up processing);
                the <span class="cd">settings</span> (built using the Options Hash idiom), and two private properties <span class="cd">_name</span> and <span class="cd">_defaults</span>
                which store the plugin name and default values locally.
                Finally, the <span class="cd">init</span> method is invoked which will initialize the plugin further now that all properties are properly set.
            </p>
            <p>
                To conserve memory all Plugin methods are associated with its prototype rather than with the instance itself.
                This ensures that all methods are shared. Here we only have an <span class="cd">init</span> method but you can add additional methods if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the template we are adding the plugin function to jQuery's <span class="cd">$.fn</span>.
                This function has a single parameter named <span class="cd">options</span>. There is no need for an element parameter because the context
                (<span class="cd">this</span> in the function) refers to the result set which has all relevant elements.  @*We will see an example of how this is used shortly.*@
            </p>
            <p>
                The remainder of the plugin function is similar to the earlier Constructor Plugin Pattern. The only difference is that here we are passing an extra <span class="cd">options</span>
                argument into the new Plugin constructor call.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <b class="font-18 open-sans">Mother of all Plugins </b><br />
                After you have written several plugins using the above boilerplate templates you may find that the process becomes rather repetitive.
                You are wondering if there is not a more generic solution to writing plugins: something along the lines of a base class (or prototype in JavaScript) which has
                all the boilerplate code and you just fill in the details. It turns out there is indeed a more generic solution which has been referred to as the DOM-to-Object Bridge Pattern.
                This sounds awkward so we will refer to it as the Mother of all Plugins pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually, if you understand the prior template we discussed, then this pattern is fairly straightforward.
                You wrap the actual registration with $.fn in a new function called plugin. It accepts the object name which contains the plugin functionality and
                the rest is quite similar to the template discussed before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the skeleton code:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
;(function ($, win, undefined) {

    $.fn.plugin = function (name, object) {
        $.fn[name] = function (options) {
            return this.each(function() {
                if (!$.data(this, name)) {
                    $.data(this, name, create(object).init(this, options)); 
                }
            };
        },
    }
    function create (obj) { // in newer browsers replace with Object.create
        function F() {};
        F.prototype = obj;
        return new F();
    }

})(jQuery, window);


</pre>
            <p>
                Your plugin object (which does not have to deal with plugin plumbing) is an object literal that has the following structure (again similar to the Constructor Function plugin patterns):
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var myPlugin = {
    init: function (element, options) {
        this.element = element;
        this.$element = $(element);
        this.settings = $.extend({}, this.defaults, options || {} );
        
        _init();
    },
    defaults: {
       color: "Yellow",
       speed: 100;
    },
    _init() {
        // internal initialization
    },
    sayColor() {               // public method
        alert(settings.color);
    }
};

</pre>
            <p>
                Finally, here is an example of how this is used:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$('selection').plugin("myPlug", myPlugin); // register with plugin plumbing

$('selection').myPlug( {color: "Green" });
$('selection').myPlug.sayColor();          // => Green

</pre>
            <br />
            <p>
                <b class="font-18 open-sans">Plugin File names</b>
                Plugins reside in their own JavaScript files and it is important that you follow generally accepted naming conventions.
                Here are examples of the source and the minified versions:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
jquery.pluginname.js
jquery.pluginname.min.js

</pre>
            <p>
                The names are always in lowercase.
            </p>
            <p>
                If shared with the open source community, include a version number:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
jquery.pluginname-2.1.js
jquery.pluginname-2.1.min.js

</pre>
            <p>
                If your project team builds multiple plugins, include another namespace which will keep them together:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
jquery.projectname.pluginname1.js
jquery.projectname.pluginname2.js

</pre>
